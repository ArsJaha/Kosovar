        <h2>The Kosovo War</h2>
        <p>The Kosovo War took place between 1998 and 1999 and was part of the larger conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The war involved ethnic Albanians in Kosovo fighting against the Serbian government forces. The war ended with NATO intervention, which led to the withdrawal of Serbian forces from the region.</p>

        <h3>Background of the Conflict</h3>
        <p>In the years leading up to the war, Kosovo, with its ethnic Albanian majority, was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was governed by Serbia. Tensions between the ethnic Albanians and the Serbian government escalated, leading to armed conflict. Ethnic Albanians sought greater autonomy and independence, while the Serbian government viewed Kosovo as an integral part of its territory.</p>

        <h3>NATO Intervention</h3>
        <p>In 1999, NATO launched an air campaign against Serbia in response to reports of mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. The intervention ultimately led to the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the establishment of a United Nations-administered territory.</p>

        <h3>Legacy of the War</h3>
        <p>The Kosovo War left a lasting impact on the region, with significant casualties and displacement of civilians. The war also contributed to the broader breakup of Yugoslavia and the subsequent push for Kosovoâ€™s independence, which was declared in 2008.</p>
